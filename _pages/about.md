Hi, I'm Shi Qiu (仇是), a junior student at the School of Physics, Peking University. My research interests include the alignment and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). I am currently an intern with [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io)'s team at UNC, where I contribute to cutting-edge AI research.
