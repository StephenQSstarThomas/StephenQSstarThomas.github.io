<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I'm Shi Qiu (‰ªáÊòØ), a senior undergraduate student at the School of Physics, Peking University. 

My research interests focus on **reasoning models and agents**, with a specific emphasis on assessing their interpretability and robust reasoning capabilities. I've also done research in **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)**, especially their evaluation and application for human society.

I am currently an intern with [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)'s team at UC Berkeley, and with [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io)'s team at UNC Chapel Hill, where I contribute to cutting-edge AI research. Additionally, I am affiliated with the AI4Physics research group led by Professors Qing-Hong Cao, Hua-Xing Zhu, and Ming-Xing Luo at the School of Physics, Peking University.
