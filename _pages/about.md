<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I'm Shi Qiu (仇是), a senior undergraduate student at the School of Physics, Peking University. 

My research focuses on LLM reasoning and agentic AI. My research explores two fundamental directions: (1) Leveraging high-quality physics knowledge to enhance model reasoning beyond superficial pattern-matching, and (2) Developing and evaluating trustworthy agentic frameworks that demonstrate robust performance in real-world applications.

I am currently an intern with [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)'s team at UC Berkeley, and with [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io)'s team at UNC Chapel Hill, where I contribute to cutting-edge AI research. Additionally, I am affiliated with the AI4Physics research group led by Professors Qing-Hong Cao, Hua-Xing Zhu, and Ming-Xing Luo at the School of Physics, Peking University. Also, I'm honored to be the ONLY undergrad advisor of [AlphaXiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org).
